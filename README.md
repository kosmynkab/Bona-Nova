<h1>Bona Nova</h1>

<h5>Description</h5>
Bona Nova is a 2017 digitisation project of Bona typeface designed in 1971 by Andrzej Heidrich, the creator of Polish banknotes. Our concept, besides giving it a digital form, was to expand the character set, design the small caps, alternates and opentype functions for the typeface. Together with the original author we created two new versions – Regular and Bold to give the family a form of a classical triad. The complete family is distributed under open font license. In 2019-2020 Bona Nova was extended with new scripts: Cyrillic’s, IPA, Greek, Vietnamese, Arabic & Hebrew.

<h5>Digital Font</h5>
In the beginning Bona Nova typeface project aimed simply to digitise the cursive style, designed originally by Andrzej Heidrich. A voice came up that in that form it will be difficult to find application for the design in common design, forcing just the display usage. This is why I gathered tons of Andrzej Heidrich lettering examples. I tried to find characteristic solutions, that would be a starting point to draw an upright version of Bona. Heidrich has his own unforgeable style, with classical proportions, limited details and subtle contrast. After preparing a complete set of upright characters I began working on the Bold version. Bona is inspired by the Italian renaissance Antiqua, which is why the newly created Bold version is just slightly thicker than the regular.

The family has multiple OpenType features such as ligatures, different figure styles (proportional, oldstyle, and tabular), small caps, contextual alternates, collection of swash characters, subscript & superscript, a set of ornamental manicules (hands), other ornaments, and case sensitive characters. More information can be found on the  [project website](https://bonanova.wtf/?lang=en).

The typeface was originally financed by the Young Poland (Młoda Polska) artistic scholarship program of the National Centre of Culture. Thanks to support of Google Bona Nova was expanded in 2020 with Hebrew script and adapted for Variable technology. [Bona Nova on Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bona+Nova).
